This is the fourth and final project of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program which was mainly developed and designed to demonstrate expertise with Exploratory and Explanatory Data Analysis

## Dataset

> goforbike site have provided us the bike rental data for each month since 2017. Here, i decided to make a comparison between the first three month of 2019 and 2020 and see whether any difference in patterns of behavior in these two similar time period over a year. there were around 600,000 records in 2019 and 900,000 records in 2020.


## Summary of Findings

> Some conclusion could be made based on the above univariate explorations. first of all, more normal customers have rented bike in 2020 than the year before. In regards to months, it seems that there was a overall growth in popularity of bike renting in both January and February, but this figure failed to follow this pattern in March. i guess that global pandemic might be an issue. in both years, 8 am and 5 pm were the most popular time for renting. In 2019 San Jose residents rented the most but this title was earned by people who live in East Bay in 2020.

> In 2019, no matter which month you rent a bike, Subscribers were in majority. the number of normal customers were almost a third of subscribers in this year. However, people welcomed this system more in march.another point is that It seems customers take a longer journey with their rented bikes than subscribers in 2019. But the figures have changed in 2020. in winter of 2020, Subscribers took a longer trip on average than Customers, but not too much.
